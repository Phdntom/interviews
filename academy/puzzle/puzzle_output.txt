The number of connected components is  20

Analyzing each connected component...

Relatedness and Unrelatedness are defined via the
weighted global eccentricity. Small eccentricity
means the topic is more related to all subjects.
Large eccentricity means that the topic is less
related to all subjects. NOTE: For unrelatedness
some items have eccenctricty=infinity, since they
are in different connected components. The numbers
reported are therefore within a given component.

Any connected component with order less than 5 is not shown.
