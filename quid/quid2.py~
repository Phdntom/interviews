'''
Python script to find similarities in poems. Uses a text vectorizer to build
a numerical representation and compare vocabularies via the cosine similarity.
The high dimensional vocabulary space makes cosine similarity a better choice
than Euclidean Distance.


Some interesting thigns to explore here would be the effect of
1) bigrams/trigrams to create better features, 
2) comparison on more than just cosine similarity
3) building in some more evaluation strategies for comparsion besides vocab
    i.e. Sentiments. Perhaps very different vocabulary poems could have similar
    emotional content/similarity.
